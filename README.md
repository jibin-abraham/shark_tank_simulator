Shark tank is a popular TV series in the US and Australia. In simple words, it involves entrepreneurs pitching in front of 5 "sharks" or ace investors. These investors would offer capital and/or mentorship to the rising entrpreneurs. In the TV show, these are the steps involved:
1. The entrepreneur states the offer (which will be how much capital he/she is seeking in return for how much of the company's equity)
2. The entrepreneurs pitch their product.
3. The "sharks" raise questions and the entrepreneurs answer them
4. The "sharks" or any one "shark" will either match the initial offer of the entrepreneur or will raise a counter offer
5. The entrepreneur can either accept the counter offer or raise another counter offer
6. The deal is made when both the entrepreneur and the "sharks/shark" accept an offer.
